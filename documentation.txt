Overall conventions
In the diagrams below, a box like this:

+---+
|   | <-- the vertical bars might be missing
+---+

represents one byte; a box like this:

+==============+
|              |
+==============+

represents a variable number of bytes.

Bytes stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since they are always treated as a unit. However, a byte considered as an integer between 0 and 255 does have a most- and least-significant bit, and since we write numbers with the most-significant digit on the left, we also write bytes with the most-significant bit on the left. In the diagrams below, we number the bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit, i.e., the bits are numbered:

+--------+
|76543210|
+--------+

Within a computer, a number may occupy multiple bytes. All multi-byte numbers in the format described here are stored with the MOST-significant byte first (at the lower memory address). For example, the decimal number 520 is stored as:

    0     1
+--------+--------+
|00000010|00001000|
+--------+--------+
 ^        ^
 |        |
 |        + less significant byte = 8
 + more significant byte = 2 x 256
